<p>This resource is used to create a PAYE income payload.</p>
<p>This resource acts as a stub for the Integration Framework.</p>
<p>The resource accepts JSON payloads.</p>
<p>The JSON payloads must match the Integration Framework schema as detailed below.</p>
<p>Example Integration Framework payloads are provided.</p>
<p>As data is 'scoped' the JSON payload submitted should be condensed to contain only the data items specific to the use case.</p>
<p>This API acts to mirror the submitted payload exactly when requesting data form the Integration Framework.</p>
<p>As filtering logic does not form part of this API it will return the exact JSON that was submitted.</p>
