<p>Use this endpoint to create details test data for an individual.</p>
<p>This resource acts as a stub for the Integration Framework (IF). It accepts JSON payloads.</p>
<p>The JSON payloads must match the IF schema. Example IF payloads are provided.</p>
<p>As data is scoped, the JSON payload that you send should only contain the data items specific to the use case.</p>
<p>As filtering logic does not form part of this API, it will return the exact JSON that was submitted.</p>
