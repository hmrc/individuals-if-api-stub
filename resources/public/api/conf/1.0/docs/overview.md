The Individuals Integration Framework Test Support API allows you to create test data for the following APIs:

- Individuals Employments
- Individuals Income
- Individuals Benefits and Credits
- Individuals Contact Details

This API does not accept duplicate entries. A unique User and Employment MUST be created prior to submitting
employments, income, benefits and credits and contact details. This can be achieved
via the `Create a Test User API`
