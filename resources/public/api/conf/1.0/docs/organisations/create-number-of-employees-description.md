Use this endpoint to create number of employees test data for an organisation.

This resource acts as a stub for the Integration Framework (IF). It accepts JSON payloads.

The JSON payloads must match the IF schema. Example IF payloads are provided.

As data is scoped, the JSON payload that you send should only contain the data items specific to the use case.

As filtering logic does not form part of this API, it will return the exact JSON that was submitted.
